# AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY — Cinematic Scroll Experience

A fully **scroll-driven, cinematic web experience** built to feel like one continuous movie rather than a conventional website. Every video, camera move, particle, and title is choreographed to your scroll position — you don't browse pages, you *direct a trailer*.

> **This is a non-commercial, Marvel-inspired fan concept** created as an educational and portfolio showcase of creative front-end development (WebGL, scroll orchestration, video performance). It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Marvel or The Walt Disney Company. All Marvel characters and trademarks belong to their respective owners.

## ✦ Overview

- **Name:** AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY
- **What it is:** An Awwwards-style, single-page, scroll-controlled cinematic experience — a void erupts into a storm, the Marvel intro scrubs frame-by-frame, a portal dive carries you into a Doctor Doom hero trailer, a 3D Doom model orbited by six auto-playing character videos, stacked movie-poster story panels, a horizontal scene timeline, a scroll-scrubbed final battle, the entire MCU timeline, and the **AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY** title reveal — then a minimal footer.
- **Inspiration:** Marvel Studios' cinematic trailers and premium Awwwards "Site of the Year" scroll experiences.
- **Purpose:** A portfolio piece demonstrating scroll orchestration, WebGL atmosphere, frame-accurate video scrubbing, and performance-minded motion design.

## ✦ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Marvel Intro** | Void → green lightning storm → the Marvel intro clip **scrubbed frame-by-frame** by scroll (forward plays, up rewinds). |
| **Scroll-Controlled Hero** | A cinematic text sequence, then a Doctor Doom trailer that scrubs with scroll — never autoplays, always driven by the user. |
| **3D Doctor Doom Section** | A procedural Doctor Doom model (Three.js) at centre with idle breathing, cape sway, cursor-look, and scroll rotation under cinematic rim lighting. |
| **Six Interactive Character Cards** | Six cards orbit the 3D model like satellites; the active card comes forward while the others pass **genuinely behind** the model (z-index straddle for real depth). |
| **Auto-Playing Character Videos** | Each card plays a looping, muted, `playsInline`, controls-free video with `object-fit: cover` — cinematic panels, not media players. |
| **Cinematic Storytelling Panels** | Six fullscreen movie-poster panels (Doctor Doom, Thor, Loki, Cyclops, Shang-Chi, Fantastic Four) rise and stack over one another, each with a bottom-right title, description, and per-panel accent theme. |
| **Horizontal Scroll Timeline** | A pinned section where vertical scroll drives a strip of scene videos **right-to-left**, each coming into focus at centre with parallax. |
| **Final Cinematic Section** | A scroll-scrubbed battle (Thor → Doom → Captain America) → the full MCU timeline panning vertically → the **AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY** title reveal (auto-playing loop). |
| **Footer** | A minimal, elegant footer that rises to close the experience. |
| **GSAP ScrollTrigger** | One scrubbed master timeline maps scroll position onto every cinematic value. |
| **Three.js / React Three Fiber** | A single transparent WebGL canvas provides the atmosphere — GLSL particles, volumetric fog, fractal lightning, portal, sparks — layered over the DOM video. |
| **Responsive Design** | Fluid layout, viewport-relative sizing, and mobile-aware orbit/typography across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile. |
| **Performance Optimizations** | All-intra video encoding for instant seeking, decoder priming, scroll-synchronous seeking (not rAF-throttled), adaptive DPR, additive-only atmosphere, and a zero-re-render signal bus. |
| **Completely silent** | No audio anywhere, by design. |

**How it works (architecture in one paragraph):** There is one fixed full-viewport "stage" and one tall invisible scroll-track. A single GSAP timeline is *scrubbed* by one ScrollTrigger over that track; it tweens a mutable singleton in `lib/signals.ts`. Every visual — the WebGL atmosphere, the DOM `<video>` elements, the orbiting cards, the stacked panels — reads from those signals each frame, so the whole film is a pure function of scroll position. Trailers are **real DOM `<video>` elements** (not WebGL textures) whose `currentTime` is seeked synchronously on the scroll event, and they're encoded **all-intra** so every seek is instant in both directions.

## ✦ The Scroll Experience

| # | Section | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Marvel Intro** | A black void builds into a green lightning storm; the Marvel intro clip scrubs frame-by-frame, then a portal dive carries the camera onward. |
| 2 | **Hero** | The website chrome enters; a cinematic text sequence plays, then the Doctor Doom trailer appears fullscreen and scrubs with scroll. |
| 3 | **Doctor Doom Showcase** | A 3D Doom model rises at centre; six character videos fly in and orbit him, active card forward, others behind — real depth. |
| 4 | **Story Panels** | Six movie-poster panels (Doom · Thor · Loki · Cyclops · Shang-Chi · Fantastic Four) rise and stack, each with bottom-right title + accent theme. |
| 5 | **Horizontal Timeline** | A pinned strip of scene videos travels right-to-left, each focusing at centre with parallax. |
| 6 | **Final Cinematic Ending** | A scroll-scrubbed battle (Thor → Doom → Captain America) → the MCU timeline pans through 18 years of saga → the **AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY** title reveal loops → the footer rises. |

## ✦ Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js **20.9+** and npm.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd avengers-doomsday

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the development server
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000

# 4. Build for production
npm run build

# 5. Run the production build locally
npm run start
```

> Best experienced on desktop with a modern GPU. The experience is intentionally long — scroll all the way through for the full film.

## ✦ Performance

- **All-intra video encoding** — the scroll-scrubbed trailers are re-encoded so every frame is a keyframe, making forward/reverse seeks instant with no stutter.
- **Real DOM videos + scroll-synchronous seeking** — `currentTime` and opacity are set on the actual scroll event (not a throttled rAF loop), so scrubbing stays locked to the pointer even under load.
- **Decoder priming** — a muted `play → pause` warms each decoder so the first seeked frame paints immediately.
- **Section-gated playback** — auto-play videos play only while their section is on-screen and pause otherwise, so nothing decodes needlessly.
- **Zero-re-render signal bus** — per-frame values live in a mutable singleton, not React state, keeping the hot path allocation- and render-free.
- **Adaptive DPR + additive-only atmosphere** — the WebGL layer scales resolution to the device and uses cheap additive materials; no heavy post-processing in the render path.
- **Responsive design** — viewport-relative units and mobile-aware orbit radius, typography, and layout across all screen sizes.
- **Optimized assets** — videos are compressed H.264/MP4 with `+faststart`; images are progressive JPEGs sized for their use.
